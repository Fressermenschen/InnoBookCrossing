## :hammer: Architecture

The architecture of the project is based on Model-View-Controller architecture. We separated the business logic of the application (Model) and the visual part of the application (View).   We choose MVC type of architecture for several reasons:

1. Separation on View and Model will increase the reusability of the code.
2. This separation makes it easier to expand and maintain the system in the future.
3. MVC simplifies the program writing and improves code readability
