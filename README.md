# InnoBookCrossing - Application for sharing books at Innopolis

The application is designed to help people share books with each other. 

The motivation of the project - We all have books that we are not currently reading. Why should a book lay on a shelf if it can be useful for another person? Using the InnoBookCrossing application book owners can easily borrow available books and book lovers take it!
